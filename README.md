# 🎵 Music Player

A simple, front-end music player built from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project was inspired by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum and serves as a way to apply the skills I've learned so far.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎧 Three curated playlists:
  - **Lofi**
  - **City Pop**
  - **Classical**
- 🖱️ Interactive UI:
  - Clickable playlist icons to navigate to each playlist
- 🎛️ Playback Controls:
  - Play / Pause
  - Next / Previous song
  - Seek through the song with a progress bar
  - Volume control slider

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**

No backend or frameworks were used — just plain front-end web development.

## 📈 Future Improvements

- 🔁 **Autoplay**: Automatically play the next song when the current one finishes.
- 🧹 **Code Cleanup**: Refactor and organize the codebase for readability and maintainability.
- 🖥️ **Backend Integration** *(future)*: Add a backend once I learn how to, potentially for storing playlists, song data, or user preferences.
